# Project Structure
The hands on project on Exploratory Data Analysis With Python and Pandas is divided into following tasks:

### Task 1: Initial Data Exploration
In this task, we are introduced to the project and learning outcomes.
We will import essential libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib and so on.

We use Pandas to read in the data, get a brief glimpse of the first few rows, and calculate some quick summary statistics of the numeric columns.

### Task 2: Univariate Analysis
In this task, we conduct univariate analysis on both continuous and categorical variables.

We first plot the distribution of customer ratings with seaborn and also overlay the mean, 25th and 75th percentile quantiles calculated using Numpy.

We then use Pandas' .hist() method to plot the distribution for all numeric variables.

Using Seaborn's .countplot() method, we see the frequency distribution of 'Branch' and 'Payment' which are categorical variables.

### Task 3: Bivariate Analysis
In this task, we conduct bivariate analysis on both continuous and categorical variables.

We use Seaborn to plot scatterplots and regression plots to identify the relationship between customer rating and gross income.

Additionally, we use Seaborn to plot a boxplot to check the difference in aggregate sales figures between the three branches of supermarkets, and to compare sales patterns between men and women.

We plot a time series graph to check for trends in gross income over a period of three months.

Task 4: Dealing With Duplicate Rows and Missing Values
In this task, we identify and deal with duplicate rows and missing values in our dataset.

We calculate the number of duplicate rows and delete them using Pandas.

We then do the same with missing values, but instead of deleting those rows, we replace missing values by the means of their respective columns.

We explore our dataset using Pandas Profiler to see how we can automate a lot of exploratory data analysis given certain conditions are met.

### Task 5: Correlation Analysis
In this task, we conduct correlation analysis on the numeric variables in our dataset.

We use Numpy to calculate the correlation between two numeric variables.

We then use pandas to calculate a correlation matrix to show all pairwise correlations of numeric variables.

Finally, we use seaborn to plot the calculated correlation matrix as a heatmap that is easily interpretable.
